Assignment: User List
The interview assignment will be in the shape of a simple CRUD app. Don't worry, we won't ask you to include an entire back-end so performing the create, read, update and delete operations shall be done entirely in the browser front-end.
The goal of the assignment is to create an app with a modern JavaScript framework with the following requirements:

We wish to display a list of Users, which consist of the following properties:
•	An employee number k
•	A first name k
•	A last name k
•	An email address k
•	A phone number k

We would like to display the users in the form of a card, the card should display the following:
•	The employee number
•	First name and last name combined
•	The email address
•	The phone number
•	A badge consisting of the user's initials
•	An edit button
•	A delete button

•	Within the application the user should be able to create new users via a modal dialog. k
•	Within the application the user should be able to edit users via a modal dialog. k 
•	Within the application the user should be able to delete users when pressing the delete button: k
•	When pressing the delete button a confirmation modal should be shown. k
